Scrap Calculator Application â€“ Ferrum Water Filters Internship Project

Built a metal scrap calculator for water purifier production line using Python Tkinter.
Developed an algorithm to take metal sheet and water filter size as inputs and give number of water filters that can be produced, and scrap metal generated as outputs. 
Reduced scrap metal accounting time by 90 minutes per week and made it feasible to reuse scrap.

Tested the application and finalised the application for the company.
